# JUnit 4
## Christian - Chapter 05 Declative Pipelines exercise
- This is a continuation of the instructions from [this repo](https://github.com/chodges7/spring-petclinic). Read the instructions there to see how to setup the jenkins and artifactory containers.
- For this repo all we need to do is add a pipeline job in the jenkins using the GUI.
	- Note: you do need to change the branch from from "\*/master" to "\*/main".
